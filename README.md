# SentimentAnalysis-on-Restuarant-reviews
  The purpose of the project, "To analyze and classify sentiments expressed in restaurant reviews using AI and ML techniques," is to develop a system that can automatically assess and categorize the sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) conveyed in customer reviews of restaurants. The project "Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews" focuses on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to assess and categorize sentiments expressed in customer reviews of restaurants. The primary objectives are:

Data Collection: Gathering a dataset of restaurant reviews from various sources, including online review platforms.

Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for analysis, including tasks like removing irrelevant characters and tokenization.

Sentiment Labeling: Manually labeling the reviews with sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral) to create a labeled dataset.

Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the text data, such as word frequency and embeddings.

Model Development: Building and training machine learning or deep learning models to automatically classify sentiments in restaurant reviews.

Deployment: Creating a user-friendly interface to deploy the sentiment analysis model, enabling users to input text and receive sentiment insights.

Visualization: Presenting the sentiment analysis results through visualizations, aiding restaurant owners and managers in understanding customer feedback.

Overall, the project aims to assist restaurants in making data-driven decisions to enhance customer experiences, improve service quality, and boost customer satisfaction by analyzing and acting upon sentiments expressed in reviews.
